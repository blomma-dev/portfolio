PORTFOLIO 2.0 

Features:

- Automatic deployment to Google Firebase after pushing to main branch on GitHub
- Possibility to rollback and view deployment history (in Firebase)
- Serves as my testing ground and portfolio for my projects

Purpose:

- After having a hard time and hassle with my previous web hosting I decided to move to "the cloud"
- Getting to know "the cloud", as it's been something big and scary I've never had my hands on
- Using Firebase allows me to push modifications live to the website at the same time I push my changes to GitHub, which conveniently saves me a lot of time
- Getting my hands on cloud and firebase, allowing me in the future to utilize this knowledge and skill gained in other projects

See it live:

- See the website live: https://blomma.dev/

Initial idea:

- After discovering Bootstrap, I decided to remake my website/portfolio
- My old website was more of a mess since I did not know proper standards in development, and was therefore not very easy to work on
- I had to upload the modified files to webserver for them to be live, which caused a lot of headache

Other thoughts:

- The website uses a lot of components from the Bootstrap example documentation, tweaked and altered to fit my needs.
- Added Weather Web App to the website
